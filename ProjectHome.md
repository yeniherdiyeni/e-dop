The current project is part of the Evolve effort to predict and prevent the spread of diseases. More specifically, the project is concentrated on augmenting the knowledge of an article by searching specific terms in an ontology and adding the related concepts, hyponims and hypernyms as metadata of the article. That would allow correlating to different articles that refer to 2 different hyponyms of the same concept. As part of the implementation, machine learning will play an important role in the feasibility of the project. This project is part of the Humanitarian FOSS Project (www.hfoss.org)
